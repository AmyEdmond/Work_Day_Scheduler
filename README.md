## Installation

## Usage

When using the daily planner to create a schedule, I open the planner then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
When scrolling down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
When viewing the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When I click into a timeblock, I can enter an event and click the save button for that timeblock.
The text for that event is saved in local storage and when I refresh the page the saved events persist.
